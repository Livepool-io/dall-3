## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Project Layout

### AI Services

The AI services and API calls to the _AI gateway_ can be found in `lib/aiServices.ts`

To connect this app to your gateway, modify the `GATEWAY_URL`in this file.

### Web3

This project uses Wagmi to fetch the gateway's remaining balance on the `TicketBroker`
